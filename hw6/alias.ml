   - After an alloca, the defined UID is the unique name for a stack slot
   - A pointer returned by a load, call, bitcast, or GEP may be aliased
   - A pointer passed as an argument to a call, bitcast, GEP, or store
     may be aliased
   - Other instructions do not define pointers

       The alias analysis should take the join over predecessors to compute the
       flow into a node. You may find the UidM.merge function useful.

       It may be useful to define a helper function that knows how to take the
       join of two SymPtr.t facts.

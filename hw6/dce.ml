(* TASK: This function should optimize a block by removing dead instructions
   - lb: a function from uids to the live-OUT set at the 
     corresponding program point
   - ab: the alias map flowing IN to each program point in the block
   - b: the current ll block

   Note: 
     Call instructions are never considered to be dead (they might produce
     side effects)

     Store instructions are not dead if the pointer written to is live _or_
     the pointer written to may be aliased.

     Other instructions are dead if the value they compute is not live.

   Hint: Consider using List.filter

(* dataflow analysis graph signature ---------------------------------------- *)
(* Interface for dataflow graphs structured in a way to facilitate 
   the general iterative dataflow analysis algorithm.                         

   The AsGraph functor in cfg.ml provides an implementation of this
   DFA_GRAPH signature that converts an LL IR control-flow graph to 
   this representation.

   NOTE: The direction of the analysis is goverened by how preds and
   succs are instantiated and how the corresponding flow function
   is defined.  This module pretends that all information is flowing
   "forward", but e.g. liveness instantiates the graph so that "forward"
   here is "backward" in the control-flow graph.

   This means that for a node n, the output information is explicitly
   represented by the "find_fact" function:
     out[n] = find_fact g n
   The input information for [n] is implicitly represented by:
     in[n] = combine preds[n] (out[n])

    (* the flow function:
       given a graph node and input fact, compute the resulting fact on the 
       output edge of the node

    val printer : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
  end

(* abstract dataflow lattice signature -------------------------------------- *)
(* The general algorithm works over a generic lattice of abstract "facts".
    - facts can be combined (this is the 'join' operation)
    - facts can be compared                                                   *)

(* generic iterative dataflow solver ---------------------------------------- *)
(* This functor takes two modules:
      Fact  - the implementation of the lattice                                
      Graph - the dataflow anlaysis graph

   It produces a module that has a single function 'solve', which 
   implements the iterative dataflow analysis described in lecture.
      - using a worklist (or workset) nodes 
        [initialized with the set of all nodes]

      - process the worklist until empty:
          . choose a node from the worklist
          . find the node's predecessors and combine their flow facts
          . apply the flow function to the combined input to find the new
            output
          . if the output has changed, update the graph and add the node's
            successors to the worklist                                        

   TASK: complete the [solve] function, which implements the above algorithm.

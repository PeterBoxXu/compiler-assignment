   of LLVMlite programs to make emitting code easier. This version
   additionally makes it possible to emit elements will be gathered up and
   "hoisted" to specific parts of the constructed CFG
   - G of gid * Ll.gdecl: allows you to output global definitions in the middle
     of the instruction stream. You will find this useful for compiling string
     literals
   - E of uid * insn: allows you to emit an instruction that will be moved up
     to the entry block of the current function. This will be useful for 
     compiling local variable declarations

(* compilation contexts ----------------------------------------------------- *)

(* To compile OAT variables, we maintain a mapping of source identifiers to the
   corresponding LLVMlite operands. Bindings are added for global OAT variables
   and local variables that are in scope. *)

module Ctxt = struct

  type t = (Ast.id * (Ll.ty * Ll.operand)) list
  let empty = []

  (* Add a binding to the context *)
  let add (c:t) (id:id) (bnd:Ll.ty * Ll.operand) : t = (id,bnd)::c

  (* Lookup a binding in the context *)
  let lookup (id:Ast.id) (c:t) : Ll.ty * Ll.operand =
    List.assoc id c

  (* Lookup a function, fail otherwise *)
  let lookup_function (id:Ast.id) (c:t) : Ll.ty * Ll.operand =
    match List.assoc id c with
    | Ptr (Fun (args, ret)), g -> Ptr (Fun (args, ret)), g
    | _ -> failwith @@ id ^ " not bound to a function"

  let lookup_function_option (id:Ast.id) (c:t) : (Ll.ty * Ll.operand) option =
    try Some (lookup_function id c) with _ -> None
  
end

(* compiling OAT types ------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* The mapping of source types onto LLVMlite is straightforward. Booleans and ints
   are represented as the corresponding integer types. OAT strings are
   pointers to bytes (I8). Arrays are the most interesting type: they are
   represented as pointers to structs where the first component is the number
   of elements in the following array.

   The trickiest part of this project will be satisfying LLVM's rudimentary type
   system. Recall that global arrays in LLVMlite need to be declared with their
   length in the type to statically allocate the right amount of memory. The 
   global strings and arrays you emit will therefore have a more specific type
   annotation than the output of cmp_rty. You will have to carefully bitcast
   gids to satisfy the LLVM type checker.

(* Compiler Invariants

   The LLVM IR type of a variable (whether global or local) that stores an Oat
   array value (or any other reference type, like "string") will always be a
   double pointer.  In general, any Oat variable of Oat-type t will be
   represented by an LLVM IR value of type Ptr (cmp_ty t).  So the Oat variable
   x : int will be represented by an LLVM IR value of type i64*, y : string will
   be represented by a value of type i8**, and arr : int[] will be represented
   by a value of type {i64, [0 x i64]}**.  Whether the LLVM IR type is a
   "single" or "double" pointer depends on whether t is a reference type.

   We can think of the compiler as paying careful attention to whether a piece
   of Oat syntax denotes the "value" of an expression or a pointer to the
   "storage space associated with it".  This is the distinction between an
   "expression" and the "left-hand-side" of an assignment statement.  Compiling
   an Oat variable identifier as an expression ("value") does the load, so
   cmp_exp called on an Oat variable of type t returns (code that) generates a
   LLVM IR value of type cmp_ty t.  Compiling an identifier as a left-hand-side
   does not do the load, so cmp_lhs called on an Oat variable of type t returns
   and operand of type (cmp_ty t)*.  Extending these invariants to account for
   array accesses: the assignment e1[e2] = e3; treats e1[e2] as a
   left-hand-side, so we compile it as follows: compile e1 as an expression to
   obtain an array value (which is of pointer of type {i64, [0 x s]}* ).
   compile e2 as an expression to obtain an operand of type i64, generate code
   that uses getelementptr to compute the offset from the array value, which is
   a pointer to the "storage space associated with e1[e2]".

   On the other hand, compiling e1[e2] as an expression (to obtain the value of
   the array), we can simply compile e1[e2] as a left-hand-side and then do the
   load.  So cmp_exp and cmp_lhs are mutually recursive.  [[Actually, as I am
   writing this, I think it could make sense to factor the Oat grammar in this
   way, which would make things clearer, I may do that for next time around.]]

 
   Consider globals7.oat

   /--------------- globals7.oat ------------------ 
   global arr = int[] null;

   int foo() { 
     var x = new int[3]; 
     arr = x; 
     x[2] = 3; 
     return arr[2]; 
   }
   /------------------------------------------------

   The translation (given by cmp_ty) of the type int[] is {i64, [0 x i64}* so
   the corresponding LLVM IR declaration will look like:

   @arr = global { i64, [0 x i64] }* null

   This means that the type of the LLVM IR identifier @arr is {i64, [0 x i64]}**
   which is consistent with the type of a locally-declared array variable.

   The local variable x would be allocated and initialized by (something like)
   the following code snippet.  Here %_x7 is the LLVM IR uid containing the
   pointer to the "storage space" for the Oat variable x.

   %_x7 = alloca { i64, [0 x i64] }*                              ;; (1)
   %_raw_array5 = call i64*  @oat_alloc_array(i64 3)              ;; (2)
   %_array6 = bitcast i64* %_raw_array5 to { i64, [0 x i64] }*    ;; (3)
   store { i64, [0 x i64]}* %_array6, { i64, [0 x i64] }** %_x7   ;; (4)

   (1) note that alloca uses cmp_ty (int[]) to find the type, so %_x7 has 
       the same type as @arr 

   (2) @oat_alloc_array allocates len+1 i64's 

   (3) we have to bitcast the result of @oat_alloc_array so we can store it
        in %_x7 

   (4) stores the resulting array value (itself a pointer) into %_x7 

  The assignment arr = x; gets compiled to (something like):

  %_x8 = load { i64, [0 x i64] }*, { i64, [0 x i64] }** %_x7     ;; (5)
  store {i64, [0 x i64] }* %_x8, { i64, [0 x i64] }** @arr       ;; (6)

  (5) load the array value (a pointer) that is stored in the address pointed 
      to by %_x7 

  (6) store the array value (a pointer) into @arr 

  The assignment x[2] = 3; gets compiled to (something like):

  %_x9 = load { i64, [0 x i64] }*, { i64, [0 x i64] }** %_x7      ;; (7)
  %_index_ptr11 = getelementptr { i64, [0 x  i64] }, 
                  { i64, [0 x i64] }* %_x9, i32 0, i32 1, i32 2   ;; (8)
  store i64 3, i64* %_index_ptr11                                 ;; (9)

  (7) as above, load the array value that is stored %_x7 

  (8) calculate the offset from the array using GEP

  (9) store 3 into the array

  Finally, return arr[2]; gets compiled to (something like) the following.
  Note that the way arr is treated is identical to x.  (Once we set up the
  translation, there is no difference between Oat globals and locals, except
  how their storage space is initially allocated.)

  %_arr12 = load { i64, [0 x i64] }*, { i64, [0 x i64] }** @arr    ;; (10)
  %_index_ptr14 = getelementptr { i64, [0 x i64] },                
                 { i64, [0 x i64] }* %_arr12, i32 0, i32 1, i32 2  ;; (11)
  %_index15 = load i64, i64* %_index_ptr14                         ;; (12)
  ret i64 %_index15

  (10) just like for %_x9, load the array value that is stored in @arr 

  (11)  calculate the array index offset

  (12) load the array value at the index 

*)

(* Global initialized arrays:

  There is another wrinkle: To compile global initialized arrays like in the
  globals4.oat, it is helpful to do a bitcast once at the global scope to
  convert the "precise type" required by the LLVM initializer to the actual
  translation type (which sets the array length to 0).  So for globals4.oat,
  the arr global would compile to (something like):

  @arr = global { i64, [0 x i64] }* bitcast 
           ({ i64, [4 x i64] }* @_global_arr5 to { i64, [0 x i64] }* ) 
  @_global_arr5 = global { i64, [4 x i64] } 
                  { i64 4, [4 x i64] [ i64 1, i64 2, i64 3, i64 4 ] }

     either that the resulting gid has type (Ptr I8), or, if the gid has type
     [n x i8] (where n is the length of the string), convert the gid to a

(* Compile a statement in context c with return typ rt. Return a new context,

   Left-hand-sides of assignment statements must either be OAT identifiers,

   program is not well-formed and your compiler may throw an error.

   Tips:
   - for local variable declarations, you will need to emit Allocas in the
     entry block of the current function using the E() constructor.

   - don't forget to add a bindings to the context for local variable 
     declarations
   
   - you can avoid some work by translating For loops to the corresponding
     While loop, building the AST and recursively calling cmp_stmt

   - you might find it helpful to reuse the code you wrote for the Call
     expression to implement the SCall statement

   - compiling the left-hand-side of an assignment is almost exactly like
     compiling the Id or Index expression. Instead of loading the resulting
     pointer, you just need to store to it!
